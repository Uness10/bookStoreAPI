# Bookstore API

This project is a simple **Bookstore API** that provides functionality for managing books, authors, customers, orders, and book sales in an e-commerce setting. It is designed using Go, with a focus on an in-memory data store, and follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns.

## Features

The API allows you to perform CRUD operations on various resources like books, authors, customers, orders, and book sales.

- **Books**: Add, retrieve, update, and delete books from the store.
- **Authors**: Add, retrieve, update, and delete authors.
- **Customers**: Manage customer information (CRUD operations).
- **Orders**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete orders.
- **Book Sales**: Record and search for book sales.

### API Endpoints

The following sections describe the API endpoints, based on the Swagger documentation.

#### Books

- **POST /books**: Create a new book.
- **GET /books/{id}**: Retrieve a book by its ID.
- **PUT /books/{id}**: Update a book by its ID.
- **DELETE /books/{id}**: Delete a book by its ID.
- **GET /books**: Search for books by filters. All books are returned if no filters are provided in the JSON request.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
/bookstore
  /handlers        # HTTP handlers for handling API requests
  /memory          # In-memory store for handling the data
  /models          # Data models representing the entities
  /repositories    # Interfaces for interacting with the data store
  /services        # Business logic layer for handling CRUD operations
  openapi.yml      # Swagger configuration
  main.go          # Entry point to run the application
```

### Directories and Files Breakdown

- **/handlers**: Contains the HTTP handler functions which process incoming requests, map them to the appropriate service methods, and return responses. Each handler is implemented using the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance exists throughout the application's lifecycle.
  - **BookHandler**: Manages HTTP operations related to books (e.g., `CreateBook`, `GetBookById`).
  - **AuthorHandler**: Handles requests for author-related operations.
  - **CustomerHandler**: Processes customer management requests.
  - **OrderHandler**: Deals with order processing.
  - **BookSaleHandler**: Manages operations related to book sales.

- **/memory**: Implements the in-memory data store using Go maps and sync mechanisms (mutexes).Each store is implemented using the Singleton design pattern to ensure only one instance exists throughout the application's lifecycle. 
  - **InMemoryBookStore**: A map-based storage for books, using Goâ€™s `sync.Mutex` for thread-safe operations.
  - **InMemoryAuthorStore**: Handles the in-memory storage for authors.
  - **InMemoryCustomerStore**: Manages customer data in memory.
  - **InMemory*OrderStore**: Stores order data, with methods for CRUD operations.
  - **InMemoryBookSaleStore**: Tracks book sales in memory, enabling quick access and modifications.

- **/models**: Defines the data models that represent entities such as books, authors, orders, and book sales.
  - **Book**: Represents a book with attributes like `ID`, `Title`, `AuthorID`, `Price`, and `Stock`.
  - **Author**: Defines an author entity with fields such as `ID`, `Name`, and `Biography`.
  - **Customer**: Represents a customer, including details like `ID`, `Name`, `Email`, and `Address`.
  - **Order**: Captures the details of an order, including `ID`, `CustomerID`, `BookIDs`, and `Status`.
  - **BookSale**: Represents a sale transaction, including `ID`, `BookID`, `Quantity`, and `SaleDate`.

- **/repositories**: Contains interfaces for data access layers, such as methods for creating, retrieving, and deleting entities from the data store.
  - **BookRepository**: An interface defining methods for managing books in the data store (e.g., `FindByID`, `Save`, `Delete`).
  - **AuthorRepository**: Interface for CRUD operations on authors.
  - **CustomerRepository**: Interface for managing customer data.
  - **OrderRepository**: Defines methods for order management.
  - **BookSaleRepository**: Interface for handling book sales.

- **/services**: Handles the business logic and interacts with the repositories for CRUD operations and data management.
  - **BookService**: Contains methods like `CreateBook`, `UpdateBook`, `DeleteBook`, and `SearchBooks`.
  - **AuthorService**: Manages operations related to authors, such as creating and retrieving author information.
  - **CustomerService**: Handles customer-related business logic, including registration and updates.
  - **OrderService**: Manages the lifecycle of orders, ensuring proper validation and processing.
  - **BookSaleService**: Handles the business logic for recording and managing book sales.

- **openapi.yml**: Swagger/OpenAPI specification for the API.
  - **API Endpoints**: Descriptions of each endpoint, including HTTP methods, paths, and expected responses.
  - **Request and Response Models**: Details of the request payloads and response formats for each endpoint.
  - **Validation Rules**: Specifications for required fields, data types, and possible error responses.

- **main.go**: The main entry point for the application, where the server is set up, and routing is initialized.
  - **Initializing Services**: Sets up the service layer with dependencies like repositories.
  - **Setting Up Routes**: Configures the HTTP router with all API endpoints, linking handlers to paths.
  - **Starting the Server**: Launches the HTTP server, listening for incoming requests on the specified port.


### Concurrency in Action

The `DispatcherWrapper` function in `main.go` is a middleware that wraps HTTP request handlers to provide concurrency control and timeout management.

```go
func DispatcherWrapper(
    w http.ResponseWriter,
    r *http.Request,
    ps httprouter.Params,
    requestHandler func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, httprouter.Params),
) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    
    clientContext := r.Context()
    requestContext, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Second)
    defer cancel()
    
    requestChannel := make(chan bool)
    
    go func() {
        requestHandler(w, r, ps)
        requestChannel <- true
    }()
    
    select {
    case <-clientContext.Done():
        log.Println("Connection Lost")
        return
    case <-requestChannel:
        log.Println("Request Done with Success")
    case <-requestContext.Done():
        log.Println("Request Timeout")
    }
}
```

#### How It Works

The dispatcher implements three key concurrency patterns:

1. **Goroutine Management**
   - Launches each request handler in a separate goroutine
   - Uses channels to communicate completion status
   - Prevents blocking on long-running requests

2. **Context Timeout**
   - Sets a 3-second timeout for each request
   - Automatically cancels requests that exceed the timeout
   - Helps prevent resource exhaustion

3. **Connection Monitoring**
   - Tracks client connection status
   - Gracefully handles client disconnections
   - Ensures proper cleanup of resources

#### Error Handling

The wrapper handles three possible scenarios:
- Successful completion: Request completes within timeout
- Client disconnection: Connection lost before completion
- Request timeout: Operation exceeds 3-second limit
